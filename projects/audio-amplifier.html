            <p class="fs-5">
                To preface, this project is still a work in progress however it's the coolest one I have done so far, so I want to share it. For this project, the design proccess was pretty much done, and all we had to to was make some simulations to come up with test cases and confirm our amp is working right, and assemble it.
                We also has the option of designing an enclosure which we are currently in the proccess of doing. This was a group project so my part was the assembly aka I spent hours hunched over a workbench soldering little tiny resistors into place... But I actually enjoyed it and it let me get in some more sldering practice.
                Here's a few pics of the build process:

            </div>
            <p class="fs-5 text-center">
                And then the final assembly in the case to this point:
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex gap-3 justify-content-center mb-3">
                <img src="../www-assets/aa.jpg" alt="IMg1" width="500px">
            </div>
            <p class="fs-5">
                We opted to add input and output connections as these were not provided with the kit, I chose 3.5mm for an input for ease of connecting a audio device and the speaker binding posts for output as they're pretty universal and could connect to other test loads that are not a speaker.
                So far the biggest lesson learned has been double, no, triple check all of your parts. Let me tell you that trying to de-solder a transistor is no fun...

                I'll update this page when the project is complete but for now, this is what we got.
